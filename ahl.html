      <h2>Architecture Engineering</h2>
      <p>Architecture Engineering combines artistic vision with scientific knowledge to design functional, sustainable, and aesthetically pleasing structures. Students engage deeply in architectural history, sustainable design, building technologies, environmental systems, and digital modeling using the latest software. Hands-on experiences through studio projects, field visits, and professional internships ensure they are industry-ready. Graduates can work as architects, urban planners, landscape designers, and project managers, contributing to the development of future smart cities and culturally enriched environments. Additionally, the department emphasizes green building design, historic preservation, and advanced urban planning techniques.</p>

      <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
      <p>Civil Engineering is the backbone of infrastructure development, dealing with the design, construction, and maintenance of bridges, roads, airports, water systems, and buildings. The curriculum includes structural analysis, soil mechanics, transportation engineering, environmental engineering, and project management. Students gain practical experience through laboratory experiments, software simulations, and real-world fieldwork. Civil engineers are crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate adaptation, sustainable development, urban resilience, and disaster risk mitigation. The program also covers sustainable materials, smart infrastructure technologies, and innovative construction management practices to ensure graduates lead future projects efficiently.</p>

      <h2>Surveying Engineering</h2>
      <p>Surveying Engineering plays a pivotal role in the planning and execution of engineering projects through precise measurements and data analysis. Students study geodesy, photogrammetry, remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and land information management. Practical training covers the operation of drones, total stations, 3D laser scanners, GPS, and RTK systems. Surveyors are indispensable for accurate land development, construction layout, environmental monitoring, and legal boundary demarcation. Moreover, students learn advanced spatial data analysis, hydrographic surveying for marine environments, and cutting-edge 3D mapping technologies, making them essential for modern development projects.</p>
